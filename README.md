My st Server 
Project Overview: This project aims to develop a concurrent server for storing data and documents from personal devices onto a single server. This server will utilize socket programming and a customized saving algorithm. It will categorize files into main directories and sub-directories and implement encryption protocols to ensure data security.

Phase 1: Initial Data Sync and Categorization

Initial Data Copy:

Upon the first connection, the server creates a 1:1 copy of the files from the client's directories.

These files are categorized into three primary areas:

Photos

Files

Videos

Sub-categorization:

Each primary category is further divided into:

Personal

Work

Projects

The files are named following a specific convention. For instance, a personal photo would be named photo.01personal.

Dynamic Path Expansion:

If a new category is added, such as internet project photos, the path name follows this pattern: photo.01work.0NWebProject.0N....

Phase 2: Monthly Data Sync and Version Control

Scheduled Sync:

Clients send an update request every first Sunday of the month.

The server scans the client's file system to identify modified and new files.

File Update and Version Control:

Unchanged Files: Files without modifications are not updated.

Modified Files: Files that have been modified since the last sync are saved with a version number, e.g., filename.v01, preserving both versions.

New Files: Newly added files are copied and transferred to the server.

Phase 3: Security Enhancements

Encryption Protocols:

Various encryption protocols are implemented to secure directories.

These protocols are designed to prevent unauthorized access and protect data from basic attackers.

Data Integrity:

Ensure data integrity during transfer and storage to prevent data corruption or loss.

Access Control:

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions and access to data based on user roles.

Additional Features:

User Interface:

Develop a user-friendly interface for both clients and administrators to manage and monitor data storage and sync processes.

Automated Alerts:

Set up automated alerts to notify users of sync status, errors, or potential security threats.

Performance Optimization:

Optimize server performance to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently.

Implement load balancing and scalability solutions to accommodate increasing data and user demands.

This expanded plan should give a clear, detailed picture of the project's scope, stages, and objectives. Each phase ensures that data is systematically categorized, securely stored, and efficiently managed, providing a robust solution for personal data backup and management.
